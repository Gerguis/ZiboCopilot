# ZiboCopilot

X-Plane 11 Utility. Uses X-Plane 11 SDK to do automated procedures for the captain (user). It simulates on what a multicrew cockpit can feel like. The only thing you have to do is to press next procedure and the copilot will comply. A similar product but payware is FS2Crewâ€™s PMDG 737 Addon.
